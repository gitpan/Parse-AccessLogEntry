DESCRIPTION
    
There are several modules that focus on generating web reports, like
Apache::ParseLog. There are also several places on the web where you can
find the regex required to parse the lines on your own. This is simply
for users who dont want to mess with any of that, and just want to have
a quick way to implement this functionality in their code.
    
This module handles the standard Apache access_log formats, including
the combined log file format that includes the referrer and user-agent.
The return form the parse() call is a hashref with key names being the
fields in the line just parsed.
    
$Hashref->{host}    client ip of the request 
$Hashref->{user}    user logged in ("-" for none) 
$Hashref->{date}    date of the request 
$Hashref->{time}    server time of the request 
$Hashref->{diffgmt} server offset from GMT
$Hashref->{rtype}   type of request (GET, POST, etc) 
$Hashref->{file}    file requested 
$Hashref->{proto}   protocol used (HTTP/1.1, etc)
$Hashref->{code}    code returned by apache (200, 304, etc)
$Hashref->{bytes}   number of bytes returned to the client
$Hashref->{refer}   referrer 
$Hashref->{agent}   user-agent

If you noticed that the RFC1413 field is missing, you're right. I don't
plan on including this anytime soon, since hardly anyone uses it.
    
This is a pretty early release. But since much of this code is lifted
from other sources it should be pretty reliable. If anybody has any
ideas on how to make it more robust then let me know.
